Things I need to do: 

Generate a chess board and render the pieces. - GUI 
Be able to take input from the GUI. 
Then write the background chess engine. 


800 width and 600 height

To make it centered, we have to give it unsymmetrical padding. 

Board should be on 400x400
width padding == 400, height padding = 200

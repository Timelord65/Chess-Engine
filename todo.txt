Things I need to do:

Generate a chess board and render the pieces. - GUI ==> DONE
Be able to take input from the GUI. ==> DONE
Then write the background chess engine. ==> WORKING


800 width and 600 height

To make it centered, we have to give it unsymmetrical padding.

Board should be on 400x400
width padding == 200, height padding = 100
Top left of board = (200, 100)
Bottom right of board = (600, 500)

Instead of black and white squares, we render green and white.
Each square is a 50x50
